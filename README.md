An online tarot card reader that performs a simple 3 card spread: past, present and future.

Made with Vue JS and Animate.css library.

The Tarot REST API I use is https://rws-cards-api.herokuapp.com/

note on tarot: The Rider Waite tarot contains 78 cards. Each has two meanings determined by position: reversed and upright. Therefore the API call returns a random card and position.
