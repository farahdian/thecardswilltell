# bad user stories tarot

An online tarot card reader that outputs user stories.

A cybermystical take on randomly generating user stories for the fun of it. Plays on the traditional three card tarot reading.

Made with Vue JS and Animate.css library.

The Tarot REST API I use is https://rws-cards-api.herokuapp.com/

note on tarot: The Rider Waite tarot contains 78 cards. Each has two meanings determined by position: reversed and upright. Therefore the API call returns a random card and position.
